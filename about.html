              My journey at the Nasser Vocational Training Centre (NCST) in Jaw
              has been incredibly transformative. As a senior high school
              student focusing on Cloud Computing, I initially felt overwhelmed
              by the complexities of the field. However, the comprehensive
              curriculum and hands-on approach quickly turned my apprehension
              into excitement. The faculty, particularly Mr. Abdelrahman Khaled,
              brought the subjects to life, making learning AWS architecture and
              cloud computing both engaging and practical.One of the most
              enriching aspects of my experience has been the
            </p>
            <p class="hidden" id="more-content-1">
              emphasis on real-world applications, especially in networking.
              Through courses on Cisco Packet Tracer and network simulation, I
              gained a deep understanding of the importance of these
              technologies in our digital age. The certifications I earned,
              including those from AWS and Cisco, symbolize not just my
              dedication but the unwavering support from my teachers and peers.
              A memorable experience was volunteering at the “Educational
              Excellence Forum: Quality Education in the Age of Artificial
              Intelligence: Challenges and Opportunities (QEEC 2024)." This
              opportunity allowed me to engage with educators and experts about
              the future of education powered by AI, providing valuable insights
              and strengthening my commitment to improving educational access
              and quality. Visiting a hospital for sick children was also deeply
              moving, teaching me the profound impact of empathy and small acts
              of kindness. These experiences at the forum and the hospital have
              shaped my perspective, inspiring me to continue striving for
              positive change in education and community service. Participating
              in the forum on AI and education was a highlight, allowing me to
              engage with thought leaders and contribute to discussions on
              future technologies. As I look forward to completing my education
              and stepping into the professional world, I carry with me the
              knowledge, skills, and memories from NCST. This experience has not
              only prepared me for a career in technology but has also shaped me
              into a confident and proactive individual ready to tackle future
              challenges.

              As of now, I am at 12th grade in NVTC School and I learn Cloud
              Computing now. When it comes to high school year, I have
              experienced lots of things and it is quite an interesting academic
              year I presume. In that year we had a very nice field trip to Fun
              Land which was really fun and relaxing after hours of learning.
              This was a day, which was full of laughter games and interactions
              with the classmates or friends whenever we were forming compact
              groups Tour was memorable in the sense that most of the friends
              moved together while shredding fun experiences that possess
              memories to this date.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden" id="more-content-2">
              As for the wide context, in grade 11 our school arranged a visit
              to the cybersecurity building. This trip was particularly
              interesting since it showed us a side of the economy most of us
              would not get the chance to see due to the nature of its function
              and workings, cyber security, a sector that is rapidly gaining
              more and more ground especially with the growing prominence of the
              digital economy. It was nice to know some of the specific measures
              that are taken when it comes to security , both as a general
              policy as well as the necessity of data protection; also got some
              real life feel of the things that we have been learning so far.
              Not only were we able to gain knowledge but many of us are now
              inspired to pursue cybersecurity as a career. Currently, as a
              student of the 12th grade, I am studying cloud computing at a very
              profound level. This field is rather promising and there is a
              great deal of opportunities within the field in the future. You
              are here to know various cloud service models, cloud deployment
              approaches, and foundational technologies of cloud computing. This
              is quite inspiring yet somewhat discouraging to observe how such
              and similar technologies are going to form the infrastructure of
              the IT and the business area in future. Now as we are almost at
              the end of the first term, our Term 1 finals are just around the
              corner. But the pressure in now on and I am attempting to study
              while keeping my desk as neat as possible. It is never easy to
              juggle between revision and other classes but I’m willing to do
              it. I want to thank my teachers and classmates for their support:
              NVTC School has one of the most cooperative atmospheres I have
              ever seen.

              My Journey in IT and Cloud Computing I'm Yousif Ahmed, a senior
              high school student at Nasser Vocational Training Centre (NCST) in
              Bahrain. My educational journey has been focused on cloud
              computing and IT. I'm working towards my High School Diploma and a
              Pearson BTEC International Level 3 Diploma in IT, both set to be
              completed in 2025. Along the way, I've earned certifications like

            <p class="hidden" id="more-content-3">
              I'm passionate about cloud computing and constantly seek on-job
              training opportunities to sharpen my skills further. I have taken
              part in various projects and internships that have allowed me to
              gain hands-on experience with cloud platforms and IT
              infrastructure. These experiences have given me a deeper

              security to deploying web applications on cloud platforms like AWS
              and Azure. Each project has provided valuable lessons in
              troubleshooting, optimization, and scaling solutions. With the
              support of my mentors, Dr. Mussab Aswad and Mr. Abdulrahman
              Khaled, I'm motivated to make significant contributions to the
              tech industry. They have guided me through complex concepts,
              encouraged me to explore new technologies, and provided invaluable
              advice on career development. I am grateful for their mentorship,
              which has been instrumental in shaping my aspirations and goals.
              As I approach graduation, I am eager to leverage my knowledge and
              skills to drive technological advancements. My goal is to join a
              dynamic team where I can continue to learn and contribute to
              innovative projects. I am particularly interested in roles that
              focus on cloud architecture, cybersecurity, and IT operations. I
              am committed to staying at the forefront of technological
              innovation and seeking opportunities that challenge me to grow
              professionally. The ever-evolving nature of cloud computing
              excites me, and I am determined to be part of the solutions that
              help businesses and organizations thrive in a digital-first world.

              In the beginning, when I joined NCST, I really didn’t know anyone
              or anything about the system and how things work around here.
              After a while, I got to make new friends and got used to the
              school system. In November of 2022, I ran for the student council
              program and luckily, I got elected to be a member. Being in the
              student council gave me the opportunity to participate in more
              organizing events and competitions, which increased my connections
              and networking opportunities. In grade 11, which was my second
              year, I was really comfortable with the system
            </p>
            <p class="hidden" id="more-content-4">
              and my friends were all with me. Many things made me appreciate
              that year, mainly because of my friends and all the memories and
              experiences we had together. That year, with all its ups and
              downs, I had a fun, memorable experience, and I think I will
              remember it for a very long time. Throughout that year, I
              developed valuable leadership skills and a deep sense of
              responsibility. Being a part of the student council required
              managing multiple tasks, coordinating events, and communicating
              effectively with council members and school administrators. These
              experiences were transformative, helping me grow as an individual
              and a leader. I faced challenges, learned to adapt quickly, and
              worked collaboratively with my peers. The friendships I made and
              the lessons I learned during that year will stay with me forever.
              They have prepared me for future academic and professional
              challenges, instilling a sense of confidence and determination in
              me. I am proud of the impact I had on my school community and look
              forward to using these skills in the next stages of my life. My
              goal is to join a dynamic team where I can continue to learn and
              contribute to innovative projects. I am particularly interested in
              roles that focus on cloud architecture, cybersecurity, and IT
              operations. I am committed to staying at the forefront of

              My story begins when I first stepped into this school. The hall
              was packed with students, and it felt overwhelming and a bit sad.
              The classrooms are quite unique. As an old-school student, I'm not
              used to such modern designs. However, some areas could use a bit
              of improvement. When it comes to teachers, some are really nice,
              while others are quite unbearable. I think all teachers need to be
              a bit strict in how they talk to students. Students should respect
              teachers in the classroom. The way most students talk and walk
              around irritates the teachers, which is why they often seem angry.

              Enough about the negatives, let's talk about something positive.
              Subjects are the main focus in any school. At NCST, they offer
              subjects that help students improve in their majors. There are
              diverse types of subjects. Let's break them into two parts:
              "Science" and "Technology." Science focuses on Engineering and
              Mechanics, which are more practical and hands-on. On the other
              hand, Technology covers AI, Cybersecurity, and Cloud Computing.
              I'm majoring in Cloud Computing, but that doesn't mean I'm
              unfamiliar with the other majors. Cloud Computing is interesting,
              but NCST makes it a bit challenging. The way students perceive
              information from the teachers involves a lot of knowledge to
              understand and demonstrate. Teachers should focus on providing
              clear, structured lessons that balance theory with practical
              applications, especially for technical fields like Cloud
              Computing. Apart from academics, NCST has a great environment for
              growth. The various extracurricular activities, workshops, and
              events offer students a chance to explore their interests and
              build essential skills. These opportunities, combined with a
              supportive peer network, make the learning experience more
              engaging and enriching. However, there’s always room for
              improvement, especially in how teaching methods align with
              industry standards and the evolving tech landscape. Teachers can
              play a pivotal role in making complex subjects more approachable
              and fostering a passion for learning among students. In
              conclusion, NCST is a place full of potential and promise, but
              like any institution, it has its challenges. With a few
              adjustments in teaching approaches and classroom management, it
              could truly shine as a beacon for future tech leaders.
